# Menmo Action AI

> Learn by doing. Remember by understanding.

## The Name

**Menmo** is inspired by **Mnemosyne** (Μνημοσύνη), the ancient Greek goddess of memory and mother of the nine Muses. In mythology, she was the personification of remembrance — the foundation of all learning, art, and knowledge.

We simplified her name to **Menmo** — easier to say, easier to remember, just like learning should be.

**Action** reflects our core belief: true learning happens through doing, not passive consumption. Watch, interact, question, repeat.

**AI** is your intelligent companion on this journey, helping you understand context, explain nuances, and remember what matters.

## Our Philosophy

### Interest-Driven Learning

The best learning happens when you're genuinely curious. That's why Menmo lets you learn from content you actually want to watch — tech talks, startup stories, science explainers, or anything that sparks your interest.

### Active Over Passive

Watching videos is passive. Menmo transforms it into an active experience:
- **Pause and ask** — Stop anytime to ask AI about what you just heard
- **Highlight and save** — Build your personal vocabulary from real context
- **Review and recall** — Spaced repetition helps you remember

### Context is Everything

Words aren't learned in isolation. Menmo keeps the full context — the video, the sentence, the moment — so you remember not just what a word means, but how it's actually used.
