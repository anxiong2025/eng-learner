# TubeMo

> Learn by doing. Remember by understanding.

## The Name

**TubeMo** combines **Tube** (from YouTube, the world's largest video platform) with **Mo** (short for Memory, Motion, and Momentum).

We believe the best way to learn a language is through content you actually enjoy watching. TubeMo transforms passive video watching into an active learning experience.

**AI** is your intelligent companion on this journey, helping you understand context, explain nuances, and remember what matters.

## Our Philosophy

### Interest-Driven Learning

The best learning happens when you're genuinely curious. That's why TubeMo lets you learn from content you actually want to watch — tech talks, startup stories, science explainers, or anything that sparks your interest.

### Active Over Passive

Watching videos is passive. TubeMo transforms it into an active experience:
- **Pause and ask** — Stop anytime to ask AI about what you just heard
- **Highlight and save** — Build your personal vocabulary from real context
- **Review and recall** — Spaced repetition helps you remember

### Context is Everything

Words aren't learned in isolation. TubeMo keeps the full context — the video, the sentence, the moment — so you remember not just what a word means, but how it's actually used.
