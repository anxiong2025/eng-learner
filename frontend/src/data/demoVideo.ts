  { index: 16, start: 77.5, end: 82.5, text: "I'm also going to share, consider this the ultimate crash course on how to use Claude Code or any agent effectively." },
  { index: 17, start: 82.5, end: 84.159, text: "Okay, let's let's get into it. So, I mean the best way to start these episodes is with sharing our screen." },
  { index: 18, start: 84.159, end: 89.5, text: "When we think of building applications using AI, using some sort of agent like cloud code or open code or codec," },
  { index: 19, start: 89.5, end: 95.0, text: "whatever it is, there's a couple of things that you always have to keep in mind." },
  { index: 20, start: 95.0, end: 99.5, text: "You know, the principles never really change." },
  { index: 21, start: 99.5, end: 105.0, text: "One thing that it's important for us to understand is however good your inputs are will dictate how good your output is." },
  { index: 22, start: 105.0, end: 110.5, text: "Right? We're getting to a point where the models are so freakishly good" },
  { index: 23, start: 110.5, end: 114.72, text: "that if you are producing quote unquote slop, it's because you've given it slop, right?" },
  { index: 24, start: 114.72, end: 120.0, text: "Um there was a time where the models weren't good enough." },
  { index: 25, start: 120.0, end: 126.0, text: "There was a time where, you know, we had serious qualms and issues with the quality of code the models gave us." },
  { index: 26, start: 126.0, end: 132.5, text: "But now we're starting to get to a point where even myself like I'm reviewing a lot more code than I write." },
  { index: 27, start: 132.5, end: 138.0, text: "And I never thought I'd be able to say that in the early uh months of 2026." },
  { index: 28, start: 138.0, end: 142.319, text: "So very important for us to understand our inputs, how good they are, how precise they are," },
  { index: 29, start: 142.319, end: 148.5, text: "how articulate they are are just as good as our outputs and will dictate just how good our outputs will be." },
  { index: 30, start: 148.5, end: 155.0, text: "And the way I want people to think about this is Greg is like imagine you were communicating this to a human to a human engineer, right?" },
  { index: 31, start: 155.0, end: 161.0, text: "If you give them sparse instructions and if anyone is in like client work," },
  { index: 32, start: 161.0, end: 167.0, text: "you realize that most clients they they they tell you one thing but you have to sort of extract the deeper thoughts of what it is they want." },
  { index: 33, start: 167.0, end: 170.64, text: "Um it's the same way when we work with these agents." },
  { index: 34, start: 170.64, end: 176.5, text: "When we work with claude code, we need to be really really precise with how we build our inputs." },
  { index: 35, start: 176.5, end: 182.0, text: "Now, what do I mean by inputs? What I mean is our PRDS or our to-do list or our plans, right?" },
  { index: 36, start: 182.0, end: 188.0, text: "Like there's, you know, people are giving you different names. Um, it doesn't really matter. It's all the same thing, right?" },
  { index: 37, start: 188.0, end: 195.0, text: "And when we think of a PRD or when we think of a to-do list or when we think of a plan, I want us to think in such a way as this." },
  { index: 38, start: 195.0, end: 200.8, text: "Let's say I'm trying to build this product, right?" },
  { index: 39, start: 200.8, end: 206.5, text: "Let's say um I don't know, Greg, any product ideas" },
  { index: 40, start: 206.5, end: 212.0, text: "me have product ideas? Yeah, that's actually the best best person to ask, right?" },
  { index: 41, start: 212.0, end: 218.0, text: "Um let's say I go on idealbrowser.com and I was just going to it." },
  { index: 42, start: 218.0, end: 224.0, text: "Yeah, pick pick the idea of the day from idea browser." },
  { index: 43, start: 224.0, end: 230.0, text: "Says it's a diagnostic tool for appliance text losing hundreds of repeat visits." },
  { index: 44, start: 230.0, end: 232.08, text: "See, I have no idea what that means, but let's say I know what that means." },
  { index: 45, start: 232.08, end: 239.0, text: "Essentially, when thinking of this idea and looking to build this into a full-fledged product," },
  { index: 46, start: 239.0, end: 245.0, text: "generally the way you're going to think is, okay, if the if product X does Y, Z, A, B, and C," },
  { index: 47, start: 245.0, end: 251.0, text: "how I would reach that is I'm going to think of features, right?" },
  { index: 48, start: 251.0, end: 257.0, text: "So, let's say there's four core features to this application that um Greg just mentioned." },
  { index: 49, start: 257.0, end: 263.0, text: "And if I have these four features built out, we can safely assume that we have said product, right?" },
  { index: 50, start: 263.0, end: 266.32, text: "The way we are to design our PRDs, to-do lists, and plans is such that we want the agent," },
  { index: 51, start: 266.32, end: 273.0, text: "the model to build out all these features, right?" },
  { index: 52, start: 273.0, end: 279.0, text: "Because all these features put together is our product." },
  { index: 53, start: 279.0, end: 285.0, text: "You see, a lot of times people will describe a product, um, not describe features," },
  { index: 54, start: 285.0, end: 291.0, text: "and will be frustrated with AI. Like AI is supposed to magically know what you're thinking about." },
  { index: 55, start: 291.0, end: 293.52, text: "Um, by the way, Greg, am I making sense so far, or am I 100% I'm with you." },
  { index: 56, start: 293.52, end: 299.5, text: "Yeah. So, we really need to think in features." },
  { index: 57, start: 299.5, end: 305.5, text: "But here's the cool part. When developing features, often times the issue with models is" },
  { index: 58, start: 305.5, end: 311.0, text: "like you'll develop a feature or like let's say the model develops a feature." },
  { index: 59, start: 311.0, end: 317.0, text: "We don't know if it works. We don't know if it did it the right way." },
  { index: 60, start: 317.0, end: 318.88, text: "That's where with all the cool Ralph stuff that's happening, we can introduce tests, right?" },
  { index: 61, start: 318.88, end: 325.0, text: "So let's say uh the model the agent builds feature one." },
  { index: 62, start: 325.0, end: 331.0, text: "Before moving on moving on to feature two, what I'm going to do is I'm going to get the model to write a test." },
  { index: 63, start: 331.0, end: 337.0, text: "If that test passes, then we'll work on the second feature." },
  { index: 64, start: 337.0, end: 343.0, text: "If that test passes, we work on the third feature. Right?" },
  { index: 65, start: 343.0, end: 346.4, text: "So we're finally entering an era where you can really build something serious with these models." },
  { index: 66, start: 346.4, end: 352.5, text: "So, instead of telling you about just uh planning, why don't we do actual planning together?" },
  { index: 67, start: 352.5, end: 358.0, text: "So, I'm going to pop up my terminal." },
  { index: 68, start: 358.0, end: 364.0, text: "So, I know everyone's afraid of the terminal, but in all honesty, if you don't know how to use a terminal, ask AI." },
  { index: 69, start: 364.0, end: 370.0, text: "Like, it's the like simplest thing." },
  { index: 70, start: 370.0, end: 372.639, text: "And if not, you can even download the Cloud Code app and go on code section, give it a specific folder you want to work on and use the app." },
  { index: 71, start: 372.639, end: 378.5, text: "Like, there's literally no excuse to not use cloud code." },
  { index: 72, start: 378.5, end: 384.5, text: "If you're afraid, boohoo, just jump into use AI. have all the tools." },
  { index: 73, start: 384.5, end: 390.5, text: "That being said, I'm just going to type in Claude and we're going to have uh Claude code open." },
  { index: 74, start: 390.5, end: 396.5, text: "And usually how people plan is they'll click shift tab, right?" },
  { index: 75, start: 396.5, end: 402.5, text: "And then you have plan mode on and you can say," },
  { index: 76, start: 402.5, end: 408.5, text: "let's say I want to build um Tik Tok UGC generating app for my marketing agency." },
  { index: 77, start: 408.5, end: 414.5, text: "I see like these UGC apps everywhere." },
  { index: 78, start: 414.5, end: 420.4, text: "Um, please help me create a plan. Write this in the in uh PRD.MD file." },
  { index: 79, start: 420.4, end: 426.5, text: "So, this is how most people have planning set up, right?" },
  { index: 80, start: 426.5, end: 432.5, text: "you'll tell Claude Code or Cursor or whatever agent uh to do the plan for you" },
  { index: 81, start: 432.5, end: 438.5, text: "and you ask it to be in some file and like it says it'd be happy to help you plan this out" },
  { index: 82, start: 438.5, end: 444.5, text: "and it'll ask you some questions etc etc." },
  { index: 83, start: 444.5, end: 448.24, text: "But I found that there's a better way to get an even more concise plan." },
  { index: 84, start: 448.24, end: 454.5, text: "And this way it actually gets you to think a lot more about tradeoffs, concerns, UIUIUX decisions" },
  { index: 85, start: 454.5, end: 460.5, text: "because most of the time you're sort of allowing the AI to have free reign over certain decisions" },
  { index: 86, start: 460.5, end: 466.5, text: "which I think uh will lead you with a finished product that you're not excited about." },
  { index: 87, start: 466.5, end: 472.5, text: "And that's invoking a special tool." },
  { index: 88, start: 472.5, end: 476.879, text: "Um I was going to show you guys the tweet but unfortunately Twitter's down right now." },
  { index: 89, start: 476.879, end: 483.0, text: "But Claude Code has a specific tool called ask user question tool." },
  { index: 90, start: 483.0, end: 489.0, text: "And essentially what this tool does, it starts to interview you about the specifics of your plan." },
  { index: 91, start: 489.0, end: 495.0, text: "Right? So I'm going to drop this prompt where it says read this plan file." },
  { index: 92, start: 495.0, end: 501.0, text: "Interview me in detail using the ask user question tool about literally anything." },
  { index: 93, start: 501.0, end: 507.0, text: "Technical implementation, UI, UX concerns, and trade-offs." },
  { index: 94, start: 507.0, end: 507.68, text: "I spelled implementation wrong. Do not judge me." },
  { index: 95, start: 507.68, end: 514.0, text: "Um, and what this is going to do is it's going to go past the plan that we have" },
  { index: 96, start: 514.0, end: 520.0, text: "and start to ask us about minute details." },
  { index: 97, start: 520.0, end: 526.0, text: "So, let's finish off this plan first. I'm just going to accept um this is internal use uh text." },
  { index: 98, start: 526.0, end: 532.0, text: "We'll use React. I just want core features. We'll submit answers." },
  { index: 99, start: 532.0, end: 537.44, text: "And then cloud code, you'll see might ask us a few more questions, but this will generally be the plan, right?" },
  { index: 100, start: 537.44, end: 543.5, text: "So it's it's not just it's not just the plan, it's the right plan, right?" },
  { index: 101, start: 543.5, end: 549.5, text: "Like to what you were saying like go back go scroll back up here the features and yeah the features and test" },
  { index: 102, start: 549.5, end: 555.5, text: "like the way I think about this and I don't know if you agree is like if you ask claude code to build you a car" },
  { index: 103, start: 555.5, end: 561.5, text: "it doesn't really know what a car is." },
  { index: 104, start: 561.5, end: 564.48, text: "It doesn't understand like you need a steering wheel and a you know a radio and you need wheels." },
  { index: 105, start: 564.48, end: 570.5, text: "So the the the hard part is trying to figure out is basically explaining what those things are" },
  { index: 106, start: 570.5, end: 576.5, text: "in a really succinct and clear way." },
  { index: 107, start: 576.5, end: 582.5, text: "And that's what this interview is basically doing. It's it's explaining each of them" },
  { index: 108, start: 582.5, end: 588.5, text: "and then we're going to test each of those features. Exactly." },
  { index: 109, start: 588.5, end: 594.959, text: "Like think of think of it this like a simple example." },
  { index: 110, start: 594.959, end: 601.0, text: "Let's say you ask the AI agent to build you a specific feature, right?" },
  { index: 111, start: 601.0, end: 607.0, text: "How is it going to present that specific feature? Did you want it in a dashboard?" },
  { index: 112, start: 607.0, end: 613.0, text: "Did you want it to be a modal? Did did it have to be a separate page?" },
  { index: 113, start: 613.0, end: 619.0, text: "Like when you don't specify these minute details, it will make the assumption for you." },
  { index: 114, start: 619.0, end: 625.0, text: "And with Ralph loops and all these type of things," },
  { index: 115, start: 625.0, end: 631.0, text: "like you might have a whole application built out and it's not exactly to the liking or the expectations you had." },
  { index: 116, start: 631.0, end: 637.0, text: "Right? So, let me continue. I'll just make some selections here just so we can move on." },
  { index: 117, start: 637.0, end: 643.0, text: "Um, and then hit submit." },
  { index: 118, start: 643.0, end: 649.0, text: "And then I'm going to pause this planning here and then I'm going to paste this." },
  { index: 119, start: 649.0, end: 655.0, text: "I'm going to say read this plan file and I'm going to tag the plan file." },
  { index: 120, start: 655.0, end: 661.0, text: "It's called prd.md. We have that right here." },
  { index: 121, start: 661.0, end: 667.0, text: "Um, and I'm going to say interview me the details about this question" },
  { index: 122, start: 667.0, end: 673.0, text: "or I don't even need to tag it because it has it in its context." },
  { index: 123, start: 673.0, end: 679.0, text: "But I just want to show you how annoyingly uh annoying this is going to get." },
  { index: 124, start: 679.0, end: 685.0, text: "Meaning it's going to keep asking me questions about said plan or said uh app idea." },
  { index: 125, start: 685.0, end: 691.0, text: "So notice how it says round one core workflow and technical foundation, right?" },
  { index: 126, start: 691.0, end: 697.0, text: "And some of the questions it might even ask you are things that you might not know about cuz you're not technical." },
  { index: 127, start: 697.0, end: 703.0, text: "So what do I do when I don't know something, Greg?" },
  { index: 128, start: 703.0, end: 709.0, text: "I'm going to copy this and I'm going to go to the chatbot of my choice," },
  { index: 129, start: 709.0, end: 715.0, text: "whether it's claude, chat, GBT, whatever, and I'm going to ask it questions." },
  { index: 130, start: 715.0, end: 721.0, text: "So if you remember earlier, it asked me generic questions about the app." },
  { index: 131, start: 721.0, end: 727.0, text: "Now it's saying, \"What's your ideal workflow for generating UGC video from start to finish?\"" },
  { index: 132, start: 727.0, end: 733.0, text: "Like notice how the questions are even more specific now." },
  { index: 133, start: 733.0, end: 739.0, text: "So it says linear stepbystep template based batch processing iterative conversational." },
  { index: 134, start: 739.0, end: 745.0, text: "So let's say I select that and it says how should the app handle agent API cost and usage." },
  { index: 135, start: 745.0, end: 751.0, text: "So now it's talking about cost right again most of the times when you just have a basic plan" },
  { index: 136, start: 751.0, end: 757.0, text: "this is not included in the plan. Right? Let's say we want to have a hard hard budget." },
  { index: 137, start: 757.0, end: 763.0, text: "Um what database and hosting approach do you want to use?" },
  { index: 138, start: 763.0, end: 769.0, text: "Most of you probably watching this have no idea." },
  { index: 139, start: 769.0, end: 775.0, text: "So I can copy this over, go to Chad GBT and ask what's the best decision." },
  { index: 140, start: 775.0, end: 781.0, text: "This is my current situation. And then you keep going." },
  { index: 141, start: 781.0, end: 787.0, text: "You keep going and you submit answers." },
  { index: 142, start: 787.0, end: 793.0, text: "So when you use this ask user question tool, the questions become more granular." },
  { index: 143, start: 793.0, end: 799.0, text: "So it asks me about core workflow and technical foundation." },
  { index: 144, start: 799.0, end: 805.0, text: "Now it's going to ask me about UI, UX, and script generation." },
  { index: 145, start: 805.0, end: 811.0, text: "If you notice the first plan that it came up with, the default plan for claude code, it was pretty basic." },
  { index: 146, start: 811.0, end: 817.0, text: "Now it's asking me, okay, what AI do I want to use for the script generation? I'll use Claude." },
  { index: 147, start: 817.0, end: 823.0, text: "Uh, what UI style aesthetic are you going for?" },
  { index: 148, start: 823.0, end: 829.0, text: "Minimal clean, dashboard heavy, creative tool field, chat first. Right." },
  { index: 149, start: 829.0, end: 835.0, text: "So hopefully, Greg, I'm making sense with like how much more questions I'm being asked" },
  { index: 150, start: 835.0, end: 841.0, text: "when I'm invoking this ask user question tool." },
  { index: 151, start: 841.0, end: 847.0, text: "Yeah, it makes complete sense. You're also you're also going to use less tokens in the end, right?" },
  { index: 152, start: 847.0, end: 853.0, text: "Because you're right. Yeah. Because the thing is the better your plan, the better your input," },
  { index: 153, start: 853.0, end: 859.0, text: "the better the initial set of documents that you give the model, um the the better the outcome." },
